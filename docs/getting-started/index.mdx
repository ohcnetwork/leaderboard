# Getting Started

This guide will help you install and set up the OHC Leaderboard for your organization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 20 or higher
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Git** for version control

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ohcnetwork/leaderboard.git
cd leaderboard
pnpm install
```

## Quick Configuration

The leaderboard is configured using a `config.yaml` file. Copy the example configuration:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Edit `config.yaml` to customize your leaderboard with your organization's information:

```yaml
org:
  name: Your Organization
  description: Your organization description
  url: https://your-org.com
  logo_url: https://your-org.com/logo.svg

meta:
  title: Leaderboard - Your Organization
  description: Track contributions across your organization
  site_url: https://leaderboard.your-org.com

leaderboard:
  data_source: https://github.com/your-org/leaderboard-data
  roles:
    core:
      name: Core Team
      description: Core team members
```

For detailed configuration options, see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/configuration-reference).

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the leaderboard.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

Build the static site:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `out/` directory, ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.
