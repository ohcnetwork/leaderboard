      "text": "Hello sir. \r\nI'm a 3rd year CSE undergrad from Chennai. I have experience in building web-apps using Django and Flask. I'm very good in Python. Also recently I was working on building APIs using Django Rest Framework (DRF), to build APIs for a Cafe Application.\r\n\r\nI would be very much thrilled to contribute to the project in any way possible. Also, can you please mention some good-first-issues, or where can I find them?"
