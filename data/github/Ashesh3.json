      "text": "I feel not all endpoints in `api.ts` need a trailing slash, and adding it in some cases will cause malfunction.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Updating a Facility fails with this change. This is because of the way `fireRequest` works.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const fireRequest = (\r\n...\r\n    if (path.length > 0) {\r\n      request.path += \"/\" + path.join(\"/\");\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a trailing slash to `updateFacility` key in the `api.ts` would lead to the final URL being: \r\n`http://localhost:4000/api/v1/facility//4a3dbe9c-8d1b-4dc1-b939-237d79d96233`\r\n(Notice the double slash there).\r\n\r\nWhich obviously errors out:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/171876150-88ec6227-f2a8-4fcf-9d10-454821a13fdc.png)\r\n\r\nSome endpoints in `api.ts` are to be without end slashes for the above reason.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue would be resolved better with this PR: https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/2395\r\nThis is because the mentioned PR modifies how `fireRequest` works and just adds a trailing slash on the fly whenever and only when its necessary.\r\n\r\n"
