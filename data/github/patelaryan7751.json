For example, using empty Unicode characters or even unintentional characters like a single dot or multiple spaces, tabs etc.\r\n> \r\n> Although adding this is a neat little change, I think it might be out of scope of the behavior we are expecting from the check there currently is (Which is only checking length of the TextField's value).\r\n> \r\n> TLDR; There would be many ways to bypass this check and it's main purpose should be limited to just nudging the user in case they hit submit without any text, accidently.\r\n> \r\n> Just my thoughts, would love to hear other opinions on this! smile\r\n\r\nYeah @Ashesh3 I completely agree on this but comment without anything looks a little unprofessional it can contain anything a dot or any single character but containing space can make it look empty :) Even in whatsapp try to send a message containing  \r\nonly spaces no character it would not allow you to send it.
