# Leaderboard System

A flexible, plugin-based leaderboard system for tracking and visualizing contributor activities across multiple data sources.

## Overview

The Leaderboard system is designed to:

- **Track Activities**: Automatically collect and track contributor activities from various sources (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible plugin system for adding new data sources
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast, static websites built with Next.js
- **Data Transparency**: All data stored in human-readable formats (Markdown, JSONL)
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over your data and infrastructure

## Key Features

### 🔌 Plugin System
Add new data sources by creating simple JavaScript plugins. No need to modify core code.

### 📊 Multiple Views
- Overall leaderboard rankings
- Individual contributor profiles
- Activity timelines and breakdowns
- Custom aggregates and metrics

### 🎨 Customizable Themes
Override the default theme with your organization's branding using a simple CSS file.

### 📝 Human-Editable Data
Contributor profiles stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter—easy to edit by hand.

### 🚀 Static Export
No server required. Deploy to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.).

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Plugin Runner**: Node.js CLI tool that fetches data from various sources
2. **Database**: LibSQL database for efficient querying during build
3. **Next.js App**: Static site generator that creates the frontend

```
Data Sources → Plugin Runner → LibSQL Database → Next.js Build → Static Site
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ohcnetwork/leaderboard.git
cd leaderboard

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate seed data (for testing)
pnpm db:seed --output=./data

# Run plugin runner
pnpm data:scrape

# Build the site
pnpm build

# Start local preview
cd apps/leaderboard-web
pnpm start
```

## Use Cases
