I have extensive experience with building django applications as well as working with react on the frontend. I also have some level of experience with DevOps(linux, scripting, CI/CD, Deploying). \r\nI believe that my skill set will be of great use in this project. I will be asking you for the opportunity to work on this amazing project.\r\nBest Regards,\r\nPramit Singh"
