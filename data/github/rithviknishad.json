App router is accessible only if the query to get the current profile responds with 200, you'll be exposed to the App router, else it'll show the Session router.\r\n\r\nWe just need to invoke the refetch of the current user query somehow whenever the JWT access token is updated in the local storage. That'd cause the AuthUserProvider component to render, and hence exposing the appropriate router based on the response.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"566\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/25143503/6c5c9540-0d5a-4edf-879c-6e183eb0c73a\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/25143503/f180b3cb-c646-4c7e-af9c-b35e8b0af0c0\">\r\n\r\n"

Nowadays we have `ButtonV2` tailwind based component which is widely used. This custom component also supports disabling based on user type, which can be specified with the `authorizedFor` prop.\r\n\r\nThis way we won't need to use seperate components to restrict access, just use the same ButtonV2 component and add authorizedFor=___.\r\n\r\nThis helps in keeping designs consistent and maintaining the codebase in long run."

Each file specified in the task contains one or more serializers that inherit `ModelSerializer`, which has to be split to separate `<ModelName>ListSerializer` and `<ModelName>DetailSerializer` so as to minimize joins. Each of these specific serializers should serialize information that is required by/used in the front end.\r\n\r\nYou may have a look at our front end and understand which all fields are required, and keep only those information in the List Serializer. DetailSerializer can inherit the list serializer and include all other information.\r\n\r\n"

Which is a `Record<key, value>` where value is a string or a ref. ID as string, right?\r\n\r\nThe parent component (eg. `AssetsList`) is getting the query params `useFilters` and all ref. ID-based filters are being resolved to appropriate objects by the parent component itself right?\r\n\r\nSo before even you reach the AssetsFilter (Slideover) component, you already have a Record<key: FilterName, value: string | ResolvedObject> right? \r\n\r\nPassing this to the slide-over should simply work right?\r\n\r\nNow for the clearFilter, the behaviour is pretty simple and straightforward across all filters. It just needs to navigate to the URL without query params. Updating the state need not be done since the qParams automatically will be updated since URL has changed, hence relevant parts will be re-rendered and states get updated.\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure if I'm missing something you are trying to convey, correct me if I'm wrong)"

      "text": "@khavinshankar definitely!! Could you help tailwind the async autocomplete field in the https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744 patient filters?\r\n\r\nGenerally, apart from that, I was thinking of having all the input components have their own validators and also be compliant with form reducers across care since we mostly have only `set_form` and `set_error` only.\r\n\r\nso that, the component's API interface would just take in the additional props (validator, reducerProps) [see this](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-2c391d69e3a85e37959e9843913cba1d1db5aa23dac46c81625b168a38c78d9cR18-R29).\r\n\r\nhowever, the components API should still be usable when not used with reducers.\r\nSo I was just taking time to document it clearly so that it's easily maintainable by everyone and changing the component API interface later would be a hassle.\r\n\r\nFor example, the text input is composed like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-e0e39dd41cb8f0b76d60275fa706cd765c8648107e45183f24781aa0cd51145f\r\nand when used with reducers, the amount of code we write would be so less, but still, it'll render out the errors and field labels without having to write separate components each time."

      "text": "@gigincg I'm thinking of taking this up.\r\n\r\nTwo approaches can be there.\r\n\r\n### 1. Client Side\r\nWhere each preset is traversed and selected at an interval controlled by the client side.\r\nHowever in this method the middleware will not be aware whether a client is using patrol mode or not, and hence other clients who might access the same camera will also not be aware of this. Set preset requests may conflict the order if more than one client accesses it.\r\n\r\n### 2. Server side\r\nAn endpoint for the camera can be exposed to enable patrol mode, and also status response can include whether the resource is in patrol mode or not. Hence every client will be aware whether it's in patrol mode or not. Presets are traversed and selected by the middleware/backend, hence order is maintained regardless of multiple clients accessing the resource. Preset traverse interval can be optionally adjusted by client."
