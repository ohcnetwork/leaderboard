I tested it on localhost and it seems `localhost` is in allowed domains. \r\n\r\nThis PR has nothing to do with the way Recaptcha renders, all it changes is just `src/Redux/fireRequest.tsx` to display the error before returning the response. \r\n\r\nThe domain you are running this test on, needs to be added in the domains section of the google Recaptcha page where you generated the API key.\r\n"

But if we then add a check for the space, we would need to address dozens other ways where the user might try to post an empty comment. For example, using empty Unicode characters or even unintentional characters like a single dot or multiple spaces, tabs etc. \r\n\r\nAlthough adding this is a neat little change, I think it might be out of scope of the behavior we are expecting from the check there currently is (Which is only checking length of the TextField's value).\r\n\r\nTLDR; There would be many ways to bypass this check and it's main purpose should be limited to just nudging the user in case they hit submit without any text, accidently.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts, would love to hear other opinions on this! \ud83d\ude04 "
