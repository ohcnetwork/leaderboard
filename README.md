## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that `pnpm` is installed on your device. You can check the steps for installation here. [Docs Link](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Starting the development server

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

- **Error: GITHUB_PAT is not configured in the environment. Request quota exhausted for request POST /graphql**

  - If you're facing this error for new contributors, follow these steps:

    1. Instead of running `pnpm dev`, create your own GitHub access token. [Read Steps here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
    2. Run the following command instead:

       ```bash
       GITHUB_PAT=<YOUR_KEY> pnpm dev
       ```

  - Alternatively, if you have the `gh cli` installed and configured on your device, you can run the following command without creating an access token:

    ```bash
    GITHUB_PAT=$(gh auth token) pnpm dev
    ```

### Installing packages

To install new packages, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm add <package_name>
```

> _You can get more info about `pnpm` through their official docs [pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/motivation)_

## How to add a new member?

Create a new markdown file with the GitHub user name in the `contributors` folder. For example, if you want to
add `john-doe` as a contributor, and create a file named `john-doe.md` in the `contributors` folder.

The file should contain the following content:

```md
---
name: John Doe
title: Full Stack Developer
github: john-doe
twitter: john-doe
linkedin: john-doe
slack: U02TDGQQPMJ
joining_date: "09/05/2022"
role: contributor
---

** A Bio about John Doe **  
_Passionate about creating scalable and distributed systems for the power grid and interested in contributing to open
source digital public goods._ (supports markdown)
```

All members marked with `role: core` and `role: operations` will be hidden from the leaderboard section by default. You can toggle their visibility by changing filters.

You will be able to see the user's profile page at `http://localhost:3000/contributors/john-doe`.

# Customizing the app

1. To add or remove a badge, edit the `config/GraduateAttributes.ts` file.

2. To Setup the repo for a new org, update
   the [scraper config](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/leaderboard/blob/060d88f1caf2190792beffaa464a2a48bfa6f2db/.github/workflows/scraper.yaml#L40) and update the `DATA_SOURCE` variable in the `.env` file to match the repo containing your organization data.

3. To change the colors, fonts, or plugins edit the `tailwind.config.js` file.
