The value we get is something like: \"919994565656\" and when we try to take out the phone number from this input we get an undefined value. One strange is if I edit anything when the test is paused and again try to submit the form, this time we get \"+91 956465656\" (notice the + sign and gap) and we are able to successfully retrieve the phone number from it using `parsePhoneNumberFromString` method. Check out the screenshot for more info:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-05-26 20-02-09](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/86483059/29a07702-a061-4ef2-866b-c698d77810f1)\r\n\r\nThe first set of console values are when the phone numbers are typed using cypress, the next one is when I tried editing one of them and re submit the form.\r\n\r\nCan anyone of you please take a look at this.
