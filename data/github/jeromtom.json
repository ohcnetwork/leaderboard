There are two problems with keeping the design consistent with \"General Instruction\" cards with reference to my local build:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83979298/222643450-d1855082-f429-404d-968a-1820e7fc6c9d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \"General Instructions\" card accepts only strings but the Procedure card would need a boolean.\r\n2.  \"General Instruction\" card is too small to show details of the Procedure.\r\n\r\nHence, I am going for \"Body Details\" card clone."
