      "text": "Clarification on the Issue:\r\n\r\n**How the Review Feature should work:**\r\n- The user must be able to set a review time in the consultation/edit consultation form. Or later on in a log update form.\r\n- Once the review time is set, then within that time if a Log Update is not filed for the patient, then the \"Review Missed\" Badge must appear on the patient card.\r\n- When a log update is filed for the patient, the preselected review time must come pre-filled in the 'review after' field in log update.\r\n- With every log update filed, the review clock must reset.\r\n- If the user, the the log update doesnt edit the 'review after' field, the same interval will continue for review, with the review call resetting with every log update.\r\n\r\nEg: I file a 1 hr review in consultation form. I file a log update in half an hr. The log update form will come prefilled with 1hr in review after field. I can choose to edit it to 2 hrs. Then once i save the log update, the clock for review must reset. If no logupdate is filed in another 2 hrs, the \"review missed\" label must appear on the patient grid in patient list. Then once i file a log update, the clock must be reset again with whatever time is mentioned for review in the latest log update.\r\n\r\n**Issues in CARE now - to be resolved**\r\n\r\n- [ ] When I select a review after time in consultation form, and later open the edit consultation form, I see the review after field as blank. I must be able to see the review time i had set previously and also have the option to edit it.\r\n- [ ] When i edit the consultation form to add/edit review time, such time must be considered from the time I edited the consultation, and not the time the original consultation was filed.\r\n- [ ] When a review is missed, an a \"review Missed\" flag appears on patient card, the flag must dissappear once I file a log update. \r\n- [ ] The log update form must come pre-filled with the previoud review time set (either on the consultation form, or on the previous log update)- the user must have option to edit it. \r\n- [ ] The \"review missed\" flag must come right below the patients name on the patient dashboard as well (https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/7ab27974-32c8-4e36-bdf9-dbf102524718/patient/cc52390c-ac8a-4af5-9806-f3df7ee1795a/consultation/7037609e-3c25-45ed-bfd8-e01c346cbd45)\r\n\r\n"
