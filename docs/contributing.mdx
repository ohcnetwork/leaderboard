```

### Set Up Development Environment

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   PGLITE_DB_PATH=../pglite-data pnpm db:prepare
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```

## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Create a feature branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/changes

### Make Your Changes

Follow the code style and best practices:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code structure
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation

### Test Your Changes

Run tests before committing:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Check for linting errors:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'
```

Commit message format:
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `style:` - Formatting
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance

Example:
```
feat: add dark mode toggle to navigation

Added a theme toggle button in the header that allows users
to switch between light, dark, and system themes.

Closes #123
```

## Pull Requests

### Before Submitting

Ensure your PR:
- [ ] Passes all tests
- [ ] Has no linting errors
- [ ] Includes tests for new features
- [ ] Updates relevant documentation
- [ ] Has a clear description

### Submit Pull Request

1. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Open a pull request on GitHub

3. Fill out the PR template:
   - Describe your changes
   - Link related issues
   - Add screenshots if applicable
   - List breaking changes

### PR Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI runs tests and linting
2. **Code Review**: Maintainers review your code
3. **Feedback**: Address review comments
4. **Approval**: PR is approved by maintainers
5. **Merge**: PR is merged into main branch

### After Merge

1. Delete your branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/amazing-feature
   git push origin --delete feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Update your fork:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type
- Use strict mode

Example:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
}

function getUser(id: string): User {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components
- Use hooks for state management
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Keep components focused and small

Example:
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ label, onClick, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow existing patterns
- Use CSS variables for colors
- Ensure dark mode support

### File Organization

```
component-name/
├── ComponentName.tsx       # Component
├── ComponentName.test.tsx  # Tests
└── index.ts               # Exports
```

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- Comment complex logic
- Explain why, not what
- Keep comments up to date
- Use JSDoc for functions

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total points for a contributor
 * @param activities - Array of activities
 * @returns Total points earned
 */
function calculatePoints(activities: Activity[]): number {
  return activities.reduce((sum, activity) => sum + activity.points, 0);
}
```

### Documentation Updates

Update documentation when:
- Adding new features
- Changing configuration
- Modifying APIs
- Fixing bugs that affect usage

## Testing

### Writing Tests

Write tests for:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases
- Error handling

Example:
```typescript
describe('calculatePoints', () => {
  it('calculates total points correctly', () => {
    const activities = [
      { points: 10 },
      { points: 20 },
      { points: 30 },
    ];
    expect(calculatePoints(activities)).toBe(60);
  });

  it('returns 0 for empty array', () => {
    expect(calculatePoints([])).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

Maintain test coverage:
- Run `pnpm test:coverage`
- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Focus on critical paths
