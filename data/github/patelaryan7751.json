But if we then add a check for the space, we would need to address dozens other ways where the user might try to post an empty comment. For example, using empty Unicode characters or even unintentional characters like a single dot or multiple spaces, tabs etc.\r\n> \r\n> Although adding this is a neat little change, I think it might be out of scope of the behavior we are expecting from the check there currently is (Which is only checking length of the TextField's value).\r\n> \r\n> TLDR; There would be many ways to bypass this check and it's main purpose should be limited to just nudging the user in case they hit submit without any text, accidently.\r\n> \r\n> Just my thoughts, would love to hear other opinions on this! smile\r\n\r\nYeah @Ashesh3 I completely agree on this but comment without anything looks a little unprofessional it can contain anything a dot or any single character but containing space can make it look empty :) Even in whatsapp try to send a message containing  \r\nonly spaces no character it would not allow you to send it. Having this check maybe a bit enhancement :smile: "
