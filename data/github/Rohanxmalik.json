      "text": "Dear Mentors,\r\n@nihal467 , @vigneshhari , @khavinshankar , @rithviknishad , @gigincg , @mathew-alex\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I am excited to contribute to the CARE project under C4GT. Having previously interned, I am familiar with technologies like the MERN stack and TypeScript. I believe this experience will enable me to make valuable contributions to the project.\r\n\r\nTo begin my contribution journey, I would like to start with some minor contributions that will help me understand the codebase better. I understand that creating a proposal is necessary before diving into major feature implementations. However, I would appreciate your guidance in setting up the project locally on my system, as it will provide me with the necessary foundation to explore and understand the codebase.\r\n\r\nCould you please help me with the project setup process? I have reviewed the existing repository for CARE (https://github.com/coronasafe/care) and would be grateful if you could provide me with step-by-step instructions or point me to any specific resources that will assist me in setting up the project environment correctly.\r\n\r\nOnce the project is set up locally, I can start by making minor contributions, such as fixing bugs, improving documentation, or refactoring code. These initial contributions will allow me to familiarize myself with the codebase, understand the workflow, and gain a better understanding of the project's requirements.\r\n\r\nAs I progress and become more comfortable with the codebase, I can then work on creating a detailed proposal for implementing new features or enhancements. This will ensure that my contributions align with the project's goals and are well-planned and coordinated.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my contribution. I am eager to get started with the CARE project and look forward to your guidance and support as I make these initial contributions and progress towards more significant feature implementations.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRohan Malik\r\nrohanxmalik06@gmail.com\r\n"
