The issue is about hiding the feed tab for patients who have a linked bed to them but that linked bad has no camera asset attached to it.\r\n\r\nExample: https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/patient/400cbedd-98d7-4f8f-b835-155ba71cc28d/consultation/6ae67a3d-305b-4404-bfd6-b21b0d0f8426\r\n\r\nThis patient has an attached bed without a camera, in this case the feed tab should be hidden:\r\n![image](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/3626859/18248974-0ec7-44ac-819a-45245be372a9)\r\n\r\nThe bed's location is `NICU`\r\nHere's the corresponding asset: (same location)\r\nhttps://care.coronasafe.in/facility/a3910fb7-db3d-4ddf-aa39-1f20e61d1453/assets/ed2edbd7-4581-434e-8c6a-4620b4d0a4a0\r\n\r\nIt's an HL7 monitor and not a camera, there are no cameras in the same location as that bed, so the feed tab should be hidden.\r\n\r\n@nihal467 can you double check this message for any corrections?"

Are you suggesting that I create a new endpoint specifically for filtering users by facility and that this endpoint should be located under the detailed view of facilities? For example, `/facilities/<facility_id>/users`? Don't we already have a dedicated endpoint for this at: https://github.com/coronasafe/care/blob/master/care/users/api/viewsets/users.py#L218\r\n\r\nJust want to make sure I understand your suggestion correctly before implementing it."

Since we're using Yarn as our primary package manager, I've removed and added packages solely using `yarn` commands. It does not touch package-lock, instead it has it's own lock file `yarn.lock` which was indeed modified during this migration. So why isn't it there in this PR? \ud83e\udd14 It's apparently ignored in the `.gitignore` file [here](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/blob/develop/.gitignore#L52).\r\nIt was recently added in [this commit](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/commit/6e53406f168d005caa5ba4a9747dd4bf25e2b320#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947R50-R52) (probably unintentionally)\r\n\r\nIdeally, it should be checked out to source control. \r\n\r\nhttps://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm\r\n\r\n> When you run either yarn or yarn add <package>, Yarn will generate a yarn.lock file within the root directory of your package. You don\u2019t need to read or understand this file - just check it into source control. When other people start using Yarn instead of npm, the yarn.lock file will ensure that they get precisely the same dependencies as you have.\r\n\r\nI made a PR resolving the above issue here: #3545"

      "text": "> @Ashesh3 can you mention the issue? Alternative numbers and WhatsApp numbers are two different things.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be the same thing. \r\n\r\nWe can set WhatsApp number on the profile page, but in the users page, the filter lists it as \"Alternative number\" and filtering works displaying it as alt number\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/180377350-7da2e812-704d-4f5b-9bd6-b4fda957b51b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/180377361-c6a47e10-0400-44cd-9377-7992b6bb2bfc.png)\r\n\r\nBut the profile page shows it as \"WhatsApp\" number.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/180377424-8b9e6aaa-3808-443a-bc8f-87553587b56c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frontend is inconsistent with how the data is stored and represented in the backend. Everywhere, the \"second number\" is referenced by \"Alternative number\" and not \"WhatsApp number\".\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care/blob/master/care/users/models.py#L216\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass User(AbstractUser):\r\n    ...\r\n    alt_phone_number = models.CharField\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe filter displays it as \"Alternative number\" too\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/180378230-0734a749-598c-44a0-ab5c-18060cfd5800.png)\r\n\r\nUpdating the said \"WhatsApp number\" actually sends it as the alternative number:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626859/180378368-e336a954-47e0-4c9f-ad08-23699b52490c.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/blob/develop/src/Components/Users/UserProfile.tsx#L491\r\n\r\n```\r\n<PhoneNumberField\r\n    --> name=\"altPhoneNumber\"\r\n        label=\"Whatsapp Number\"\r\n    --> value={states.form.altPhoneNumber}\r\n        onChange={ (value: string) =>\r\n    -->     handleWhatsappNumChange(value, \"altPhoneNumber\")\r\n        }\r\n    errors={states.errors.altPhoneNumber}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it appears that \"WhatsApp number\" is actually just the \"Alternative number\" but mislabeled."

If they site-key permits itself to be used on the domain you are testing the site on, it would work, otherwise Recaptcha will fail to render. I tested it on localhost and it seems `localhost` is in allowed domains. \r\n\r\nThis PR has nothing to do with the way Recaptcha renders, all it changes is just `src/Redux/fireRequest.tsx` to display the error before returning the response. \r\n\r\nThe domain you are running this test on, needs to be added in the domains section of the google Recaptcha page where you generated the API key.\r\n"
